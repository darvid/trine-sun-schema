# trine-sun-schema

These schema files are used to generate most, if not all of the database-bound
custom content on Sun WoW, using [Trine](http://github.com/darvid/trine), a
tool that uses YAML as a data manipulation language (DML).

* **glyphtrainers.yml** renames the goblin class trainers and turns them into
  vendors, with class glyphs in each trainer/vendor.
* **quests.yml** creates the custom quest chain for new users.
* **starting.yml** sets the starting area for all races to Grizzlemaw.
* **vendors.yml** creates all vendors for the SUN mall, located in Grizzlemaw,
  and sets the prices for all items available to players.
* the **itemlists** directory contains the various lists of item sets and
  general goods sold by mall vendors.
